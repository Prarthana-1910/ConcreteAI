# **ConcreteAI — Intelligent Concrete Mix Optimization**

ConcreteAI is an AI-driven engineering system that predicts **concrete compressive strength**, **material cost**, and **CO₂ emissions** from user-defined mix parameters. It supports performance optimization and sustainable construction planning.

---

## **Objective**

Conventional concrete testing is time-intensive and reactive. This project introduces **predictive modeling** to evaluate mix performance instantly, reducing trial batches, material waste, and design uncertainty.

---

## **Key Features**

* **Strength Prediction** — ML-based compressive strength estimation
* **Cost Analysis** — Mix-wise material cost calculation
* **Carbon Footprint Estimation** — CO₂ emission assessment
* **Mix Optimization** — Balance between strength, cost, and sustainability
* **Data-Driven Decision Support** for engineering applications

---

## **System Workflow**

1. User inputs material quantities (cement, water, aggregates, admixtures, SCMs, etc.)
2. Trained ML models process the feature set
3. System outputs:

   * Predicted compressive strength
   * Estimated material cost
   * Estimated CO₂ emissions
4. Results guide optimized mix selection
